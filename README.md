# Functional Programming

For this assignment I made a movie web app, using the API from [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/)
I followed [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Bvt6BFf6_U&t=1009s) youtube tutorial, of a coder doing a project from a [Javascript course from Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/50-projects-50-days/). In the web app you can filter and search movies by categories.
